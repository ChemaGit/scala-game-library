/** Provides Android implementation for games services
  *
  * Games services are features that request the use of a server to
  * sync data between players. The most common example is the Google
  * games services which provide out-of-the-box many useful services such
  * as leaderboards, achievements, and saved games. But leaderboard could
  * be provided by an alternative service as well, or maybe your own
  * custom implementation.
  *
  * Note that in theory achievements don't need a shared server, so maybe
  * this should not be part of services.
